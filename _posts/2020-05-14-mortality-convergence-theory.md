A good place to start is the theory of demographic transition. In its phenomenological version, this theory is a sort of definition, which states that a large sustained reduction in mortality is after a lag followed by a reduction in fertility. While this may describe the development of many populations, historical and current, it is not particularly helpful for identifying what drove the mortality reduction, so it may be helped along by policy, for example. The more fundamental version of the theory proposes some determinants for the underlying drivers of the phenomenon, which Burch summarises as: "modernisation, economic growth, secularisation, individualism, technological developments in medicine and fertility control, and so forth" (p. 12). Since books have been written on the topic (e.g., [Caldwell 2007](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4020-4498-4.pdf)), I won't delve deeper here. I will simply observe that this theory has a different purpose to mine, more expansive and general, so I must turn elsewhere to find models that more precisely address the question of mortality convergence in the EU. Nevertheless, the detour is helpful, because I understand that the more precise models will likely be rooted in the ideas of the demographic transition.

Indeed, this is what I found when I came across a series of papers by France Mesl√© and Jacques Vallin on the topic of mortality convergence in 20th Century Europe. In fact,
