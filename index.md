## Nice to meet you!

I am a physician and epidemiologist working in the Department of International health
at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/).

I am also a PhD student in health demography at [IMPRS-PHDS](https://www.imprs-phds.mpg.de/), advised by Helmut Brand, Fanny Janssen and Tobias Vogt. My PhD is focused on structural determinants of mortality convergence in the European Union, particularly social and economic policy.
