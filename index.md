## Nice to meet you!

I am an epidemiologist working in the Department of International health
at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/).

I focus on structural determinants of health disparities in the European Union.

Have a look at my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B_gLP0QAAAAJ&hl=en).
